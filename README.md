Title: Animated PacMen

Description: I created a couple buttons. One button is to create a Pacman, and the other button is to make Pacman move across the screen. You can create as many Pacmen as you want by clicking the button.

Directions: Download all files from the repository. Then upload them to your server, once they are uploaded, load index.html into your browser. Use the buttons at the top of the page to start the game.

Future Improvements: In the future I plan on creating ghost that will also move back and forth across the screen with Pacman.
